#  Artificial Intelligence (AI) â€“ Class Notes

##  What is AI?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the ability of machines to **think, learn, and act** like humans. It helps computers do smart tasks like talking, recognizing faces, playing games, and making decisions.

##  Types of AI

 1.  ANI â€“ Artificial Narrow Intelligence
- Also called **Weak AI**.
- Can do only **one specific task** (like face recognition or voice assistant).
- Not human-like in behavior.

 2. AGI â€“ Artificial General Intelligence
- Also called **Strong AI**.
- Can **think, learn, and perform tasks like humans**.
- Example: Medical robots doing surgeries or diagnosing diseases.

 3.  ASI â€“ Artificial Super Intelligence
- Smarter than humans in **every way**.
- Can solve problems humans can't.
- Still a **future concept** (not yet achieved).

- Domains of AI

 ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning (ML)
- A way to make machines learn from data.
- Helps AI **improve automatically** with experience.

 Types of ML:
1. **Supervised Learning** â€“ Learns from labeled data.  
   _Example: Email spam filter._

2. **Unsupervised Learning** â€“ Learns from patterns in unlabeled data.  
   _Example: Grouping customers based on behavior._

3. **Reinforcement Learning** â€“ Learns by **trial and error**.  
   _Example: Game-playing bots._

4. **Semi-Supervised Learning** â€“ Mix of labeled + unlabeled data.  
   _Example: Image classification with few labeled samples._

ðŸ”¹ Deep Learning
- A part of ML using **neural networks**.
- Very good at tasks like image, speech, and text recognition.

ðŸ”¹ Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Allows computers to **understand and speak human language**.
- Used in chatbots, translation, and sentiment analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Fuzzy Logic
- Helps machines make decisions when the info is **not clear or perfect**.
- Example: Smart AC adjusting temperature based on "hot", "warm", or "cool".

ðŸ”¹ Robotics
- Combines AI with machines to make **intelligent robots**.
- Example: Self-driving cars, delivery robots.
